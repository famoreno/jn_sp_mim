This notebook covers some second-derivative based methods ike:\n\n- Laplace operator\n- LoG operator\n- Canny algorithm\n\nWe will not implement those operators because they are more complex and it may take some time. Luckily, they are already implemented in openCV (`cv2.Laplacian` and  `cv2.Canny`) and we will used them in this notebook.\n\n## Problem context - Edge detection for medical images\n\nUnfortunately, you were not accepted (yet!) by the researching team at *Hospital Clínico* because the obtained results in the previous notebook were not as good as expected. Anyway, they have shown you the algorithms that they are currently using so you can study it for future interviews. Let's have a look!\n\n<img src=\"./images/hired.jpg\" width=\"400\">"
