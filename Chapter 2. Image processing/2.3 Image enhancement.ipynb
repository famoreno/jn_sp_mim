In this lesson we will experiment with:\n\n- Non-linear look-up tables\n- Histogram equalization\n\nAlso, some color-space conversions are going to be needed. If you are not familiar with YCrCb color space, notebook number 2 in **Appendices** contains some information about it.\n\n## Problem context - Some Photoshop techniques\n\n<img src=\"./images/ps.png\" width=\"200\">\n\nAdobe Photoshop is software that is extensively used for raster image editing, graphic design and digital art. It makes use of layering to allow for depth and flexibility in the design and editing process, as well as provide powerful editing tools that, when combined, are capable of just about anything. \n\n**It is also an extreme powerful tool for image processing**. There are thousands of image processing methods implemented that people use all the time. From simple tools for cropping images to complex tools for blurring or refining edges.\n\nToday, we are going to develop and test two methods that are implemented in Adobe Photoshop: [**gamma**](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-adjust-gamma-in-photoshop) and [**equalize**](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/2160198)."

It accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values, i.e. stretching out the intensity range of the image. This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data is represented by close contrast values. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.\n\n<img src=\"./images/equalization.png\" width=\"300\" />$\\\\[5pt]$\n\nSo what [**equalize**](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/2160198) method does is histogram equalization. But.. how is this equalization achieved?\n\n- First we have to calculate the PMF ([probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function)) of all the pixels in this image. Basically, this is a normalization of the histogram.\n\n- Next step involves calculation of CDF ([cumulative distributive function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)). Getting the LUT for histogram equalization.\n\n- Finally, apply obtained LUT. $\\\\[10pt]$\n\n<img src=\"./images/equalize_theory.png\" width=\"600\" />$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n**<span style=\"color:red\">EXERCISE 2.3.2 -- </span>** Similarly to the previous exercise, **you are asked to** develop a function called **equalize_chart**.
