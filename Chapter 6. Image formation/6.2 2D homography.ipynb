In the previous notebook we applied rotations and translations to 3D points, which are of 3D euclidean homographies.\n\nAny two images of the same planar surface in space are related by a homography. This has many practical applications, such as image rectification, image registration, etc. For 2D homographies, we have a $3x3$ matrix containing the linear transformation:$\\\\[010pt]$\n\n$\\hspace{8cm} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & 1 \\end{bmatrix}  \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\  1\\end{bmatrix} =  \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\\\  w\\end{bmatrix}\\hspace{2cm} \\begin{array}{rcr} x' = u\\ /\\ w \\\\ y' = v \\ / \\ w \\end{array}\\\\[5pt] $ \n\n<img src=\"./images/intro_homography.png\" width=\"400\"/>$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n**In this notebook we will learn:**\n\n- different types of homography\n- how to solve a homography in 2D\n- when a homography can be applied\n\n## Problem context - Homography in american football\n\nAmerican football is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. For our practise, we only need to know some points about this sport:  \n\n- The offense (the team with possession of the football) has 4 tries (called downs) for making the ball advance at least 10 yards (approx 9 meters). \n- If a player pass the **down line** (yellow) with the ball, the offense have another 4 tries to advance 10 yards (from the point where the football was lost). \n- **On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience. Also, a blue line is superimposed showing where the play (the football) starts.**:$\\\\[10pt]$\n\n<img src=\"./images/example_football.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>$\\\\[3pt]$\n\nAs you can see in the image above, the offense is in the **3rd try** for advancing 10 yards (they advanced 5 yards in previous tries, so **the objective is 5 yards**). That information is given by a rectangle placed in the field showing **3rd (try) & 5 (yards to go)**.\n\nOur objective in this notebook is to **place the blue line** (where the ball starts), the **yellow line** (down line) and the placed **rectangle** (which gives to the audience some information) **using homographies**."

      "source": "As you can see, the perspective of the image has been **removed** and the resultant image is *like* an image taken from the air.\n\nBut, you can see that the coefficient of the employed matrix are not some randomly picked numbers, so how can you obtain the specific matrix `M` that is able to do this? The short answer is from a set of corresponding points (rings any bell?). And going one step further: **How can a matrix `M` be obtained having pairs of correspondences**?  \n\nJust as a preview, in the example above, we have used the four corners of the rectangle that the white lines are forming and we have made them corresponded with an actual rectangle without perspective. Do not worry, we will explain this later, but first let's have a look at the maths behind this.\n\n### Solving the homography 2D: Direct Lineal Transformation (DLT)\n\nAs you know, a general 2D homography that converts a point $p=(x,y)$ to another point $p'=(x',y')$ looks like this (in homogeneous coordinates):$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n$$\\lambda \\begin{bmatrix}x' \\\\ y' \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} h_{00} & h_{01} & h_{02} \\\\ h_{10} & h_{11} & h_{12}\\\\ h_{20} & h_{21} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nIf we know the coordinates of the corresponding points, we can build an equation system to solve the coefficients of the matrix. Furhtermore, knowing a certain amount of corresponding points that share the same homography will allow us to get a(n) (over)determined equation system to get them.  \n\nIn this case, from a certain pair of points $i$, we can form a linear equation system in order to isolate the matrix variables:$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\nx'_i = \\frac{h_{00}x_i + h_{01}y_i + h_{02}}{h_{20}x_i + h_{21}y_i + 1}\\  \\longrightarrow \\ x'_i(h_{20}x_i + h_{21}y_i + 1) = h_{00}x_i + h_{01}y_i + h_{02} \\\\[10pt]\ny'_i = \\frac{h_{10}x_i + h_{11}y_i + h_{12}}{h_{20}x_i + h_{21}y_i + 1}\\ \\longrightarrow \\ y'_i(h_{20}x_i + h_{21}y_i + 1) = h_{10}x_i + h_{11}y_i + h_{12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$\n$\\\\[10pt]$\n$$A\\mathbf{h} = 0 \\longrightarrow\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-x_i & -y_i & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x'_ix_i & x'_iy_i & x'_i \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -x_i & -y_i & -1 & y'_ix_i & y'_iy_i & y'_i\n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nh_{00} \\\\ h_{01} \\\\ h_{02} \\\\ h_{10} \\\\ h_{11} \\\\ h_{12} \\\\ h_{20} \\\\ h_{21} \\\\ 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\\\[5pt]\n$$\n\nYou can see that with less than 4 independent points ($rank(A) \\lt 8$), there are infinitely many solutions behind $k\\textbf{h}$.\n\nBut, if we have **4 or more independent pair of points**:$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n$$Ah = 0 \\longrightarrow\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-x_1 & -y_1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x'_1x_1 & x'_1y_1 & x'_1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1 & -y_1 & -1 & y'_1x_1 & y'_1y_1 & y'_1 \\\\\n& & & &\\vdots \\\\\n-x_n & -y_n & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x'_nx_n & x'_ny_n & x'_n \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -x_n & -y_n & -1 & y'_nx_n & y'_ny_n & y'_n \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nh_{00} \\\\ h_{01} \\\\ h_{02} \\\\ h_{10} \\\\ h_{11} \\\\ h_{12} \\\\ h_{20} \\\\ h_{21} \\\\ 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \n= \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\0\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n\n- For $\\textbf{n = 4}$ **independent pair of points** ($rank(A) = 8$), there is a solution $k\\textbf{h}$ with $\\textbf{h} \\ne 0, k \\ne 0$. This should be sufficient (and strictly it is, as we will test later), but the solution will be highly affected by the noise in the points coordinates, so this is not usually used for automatically detected oints, but for manually chosen ones.$\\\\[5pt]$\n- For $\\textbf{n > 4}$ **independent pair of points** ($rank(A) \\gt 8$), (e.g. those pair of points detected by SIFT) there is not a solution (apart from $\\textbf{h} = 0$) as the system is overdetermined but we can get the solution that minimizes the error in the points coordinates (that is, the least-squares solution): $\\\\[5pt]$\n\n    - Arg. min$_h ||\\textbf{Ah}||^2$ with $||\\textbf{h}|| = 1$$\\\\[5pt]$\n    - Solution $\\hat{h}$: eigenvector of the smallest eigenvalue of $A^TA$\n    \nNote that if you know the specific type of the transformation, you may need less points for solve this equation system:\n\n- **Translation** (2 unknowns) $\\rightarrow$ **1 pair of points needed**\n- **Euclidean** (3 unknowns) $\\rightarrow$ **2 pair of points needed**\n- **Similarity** (4 unknowns) $\\rightarrow$ **2 pair of points needed**\n- **Affine** (6 unknowns) $\\rightarrow$ **3 pair of points needed**\n- **Projective** (8 unknowns) $\\rightarrow$ **4 pair of points needed**\n\nBut, as we said, usually, you need many more points for noise roboustness, so this is not revelant at all.  \n\nAlso, each type of transformation has some transformations and invariants, the table below resume this:$\\\\[10pt]$\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 23px;border: 1px solid black;\">\n<th style=\"height:

So, we need to know when can we apply a homography. \n\nIt can be said that there is a homography $H_{3\\times3}$ between points in these 3 cases:\n\n<img src=\"./images/applications.png\" width=\"800\" />\n\nIn this exercise we have had a **still camera** and we have transformed a image plane to another. Since the players are not in the same plane that the football field, the homography is not valid for those points.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also an homography **for a rotating camera observing a non-planar scene**. Actually, this would the next step for **image stitching** after computing matches with keypoints in the example application in Chapter 4. We already have the correspondences either using Harris or SIFT, so the homography should be easy to obtain.$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n<img src=\"./images/stitching.png\" width=\"800\" />$\\\\[5pt]$\n\nFinally, there are a homography for a **moving camera observing a plane**. This is the typical case of 2 images of a painting taken from different positions:$\\\\[5pt]$\n\n<img src=\"./images/painting.png\" width=\"400\" />\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFantastic work! Homographies are a very important tool in computer vision. In this notebook you have\n\n- learnt what a homography is, how to solve it and how to apply it.\n- learnt when a homography can be used.\n- applied homographies to lines.\n- learnt some homography applications that are currently being used in american football (and other sports too! think about placing advertising on a tennis or footbal court)."
